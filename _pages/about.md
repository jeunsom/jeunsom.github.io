I am Eunsom Jeon, PhD candidate at ASU. I work as a research assistant at [Geometric Media Lab](https://pavanturaga.com/) advised under Prof. Pavan Turaga.
Before joining ASU, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Korea Telecom (Institute of Convergence Technology)](https://www.kt.com/), Seoul, Korea.
I received Bachelor and Master's degree from [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/main), Seoul, Korea, and worked as a research assistant with [Digital Media Lab](http://dm.dongguk.edu/) advised by Prof. Kang Ryoung Park.
My current research interests include knowledge distillation, multimodal data analysis (time-series and image data analysis), human behavior analysis, deep learning, and artificial analysis.
